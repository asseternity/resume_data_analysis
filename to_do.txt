[v] write a draft intro
[v] rename SQL files
[v] rewrite comments throughout the main file

[_] create a new kaggle script-mode notebook
[_] add data -> search for the existing data I used 
[_] pin the dataset so it stays loaded even across commits
[_] upload
- resume_data_cleaner.py
- All .sql files (e.g. lawyers_degrees.sql, education_query.sql, etc.)
[_] Markdown:
- Project title & overview at top
- Before each SQL block: a 1–2-line explanation
- After each chart: a brief insight or “key takeaway”
- “Key Takeaways” section at the very end with bullet points of your main findings—great for skimmers.
[_] Save & Run
[_] Commit & Publish
