[v] write a draft intro
[v] rename SQL files
[v] rewrite comments throughout the main file
- Turn inline comments into short section headers (e.g. # ─── Data Cleaning ───), so they stand out in Script mode.
[v] create a new kaggle script-mode notebook
[v] add data -> search for the existing data I used 
[v] pin the dataset so it stays loaded even across commits
[v] Copy-paste the contents of main.py into a series of code cells, breaking it up by logical sections:
- Cell 1: Imports & dataset download
- Cell 2: Data cleaning
- Cell 3+: Each SQL + plotting block
[v] upload
- resume_data_cleaner.py
- All .sql files (e.g. lawyers_degrees.sql, education_query.sql, etc.)
[v] Address error
[v] Save & Run
[v] Commit & Publish
[v] Improve markdown for best viewing:
- Project title & overview at top
- Before each SQL block: a 1–2-line explanation
[v] choose 2–3 relevant tags (e.g. SQL, Seaborn, Data Cleaning) so your project surfaces in searches.
[_] Conclusions
- After each chart a markdown section: a brief insight or “key takeaway”
- “Key Takeaways” section at the very end with bullet points of your main findings—great for skimmers.
